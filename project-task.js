üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

// ============================================
// üîç Provided JSON File with Errors
// ============================================

const invalidBookingJSON = `
{
  "hotelName": "Grand City Hotel",
  "checkInDate": "2024-05-15"
  "checkOutDate": "2024-05-20",
  "guests": [
    {
      name: "Alice Johnson",
      "age": 30,
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob Smith",

  }
}
`;


// ============================================
// ‚úÖ Requirements
// ============================================

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version - Used this 
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON? 
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?

// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors? 
Ans - Two-Three erros I have noticed the moment I saw the code in detail, they are missing coma, quotation marks for checkInDate,name property. Age key was undefined changhed to null. There was extra comma after parking. Then I put the whole code in jsonlint.com and clicked on validate. Upon clicking on validate I have seen errors poped. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid? 
Ans - I used the jsonlint.com link provided above to check whether my code was right.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why? 
Ans - for me unefined was the last one I got and changed to null. I realised it little late.
4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)
Ans - Using the jsonlint to check the code always as json file needs to follow strict rules.
